# Define the variables
principal = 1000     # This is the initial amount of money
rate = 0.05          # This is the interest rate (5%)
time = 3             # This is the time in years

# Calculate simple interest
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the result
print("The simple interest is:", interest)
